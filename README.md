This project focuses on analyzing the Uber income dataset, which contains information about various factors that can impact income, such as age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, and more. The dataset has been divided into two categories based on income: less than 50k and greater than 50k.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of the following columns:

- Age: The age of the individual
- Workclass: The type of workclass the individual belongs to
- Fnlwgt: The final weight assigned to the individual in the survey
- Education: The highest level of education attained by the individual
- Education-num: The numerical representation of education level
- Marital-status: The marital status of the individual
- Occupation: The occupation of the individual
- Relationship: The relationship status of the individual
- Race: The race of the individual
- Sex: The gender of the individual
- Capital-gain: The capital gains of the individual
- Capital-loss: The capital losses of the individual
- Hours-per-week: The number of hours worked per week
- Native-country: The native country of the individual
- Income: The income level of the individual (less than 50k or greater than 50k)

## Data Analysis

In this project, we aim to perform various data analysis tasks on the Uber income dataset to gain insights into the factors that influence income levels. Some of the analysis tasks we will cover include:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will explore the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, and perform initial data cleaning tasks.

2. Data Visualization: Utilizing the power of libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we will create informative visualizations to better understand the relationships between different variables and their impact on income levels.

3. Statistical Analysis: We will conduct statistical analysis to uncover any significant correlations or patterns within the dataset. 



## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Place the Uber income dataset file (income_evaluation.csv) in the project directory.

4. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or execute the Python scripts to perform the desired data analysis tasks.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the Uber income dataset, we aim to gain insights into the factors that contribute to income levels and develop a better understanding of the Uber driver income distribution. This analysis can provide valuable information for both Uber drivers and the company itself to make informed decisions regarding earnings and driver incentives.
